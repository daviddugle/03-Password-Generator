# 03-Password-Generator
*Pseudocoded the page
This was my first go at JavaScript. I found it to be relatively understandable until I had to pull random numbers out of four different arrays. I feel like I did a good job and this is a good starting point for me.

This project was to test my ability to create a random password using JavaScript.

The HTML would load and there would be a button to create a password. Once the button was selected the user would indicate how many characters they wanted. Once they did that they would have to confirm if their password would contain either; uppercase, lowercase, special characters or numbers. 

After it was completed I can say that it was a lot of fun.
